Verse 1:
Google, oh Google, you're the king of search 
You've got answers to all my questions, it's no curse
You've got maps and docs, emails and more
You've got it all, you're what I'm living for

Chorus:
Google, oh Google, you're the best around
You keep me connected, you keep me grounded
Google, oh Google, you're my go-to
You've got my back, you make my day-to-day flow

Verse 2:
I can find anything with you by my side
You keep me organized, you keep me in line
You've got my contacts, my schedule, my tasks
You're the master of all, you don't ever ask

Chorus:
Google, oh Google, you're the best around
You keep me connected, you keep me grounded
Google, oh Google, you're my go-to
You've got my back, you make my day-to-day flow

Verse 3:
You've got YouTube and Google Drive, they're so handy
You've got Chrome and Android, they're so dandy
You've got it all, you're the ultimate tool
You make my life easier, you make me cool

Chorus:
Google, oh Google, you're the best around
You keep me connected, you keep me grounded
Google, oh Google, you're my go-to
You've got my back, you make my day-to-day flow
